### 2. SEO Best Practices Implemented

2. **Trust Signal**: Test specific number vs percentage: "5,000+ people" vs "92% see improvement"
3. **Pricing Titles**: Test outcome vs feature: "For lasting change" vs "Get all features"
4. **FAQ Order**: Test privacy first vs "how it helps" first

**Medium-Impact Tests:**
