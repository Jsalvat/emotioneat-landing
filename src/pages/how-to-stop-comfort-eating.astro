  {
    question: "How long does it take to stop comfort eating?",
    answer: "Most users notice increased awareness within the first week. Breaking the automatic habit typically takes 2-4 weeks of consistent daily check-ins. The key is building new neural pathways—responding to emotions differently until it becomes natural. EmotionEat supports you through this process with daily conversations and pattern insights."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I comfort eat even when I know I shouldn't?",
    answer: "Comfort eating is an automatic emotional response, not a conscious choice. Your brain learned that food provides relief, and it now triggers that response before you can think about it. The solution isn't more willpower—it's building awareness so you can pause before the automatic response kicks in."
  },
  {
    question: "Will EmotionEat tell me what to eat?",
    answer: "No. EmotionEat focuses entirely on the emotional side of eating—understanding why you eat, not what you eat. We don't provide meal plans, calorie counts, or food rules. Our goal is helping you develop emotional awareness so you can make conscious choices about food."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I've tried everything to stop comfort eating?",
    answer: "Most approaches focus on food restriction or willpower, which don't address the root cause. EmotionEat is different because it focuses on understanding your emotions and triggers. Many users who've \"tried everything\" find success because we target the actual problem: the emotional need driving the eating."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use EmotionEat when I'm about to comfort eat?",
    answer: "Absolutely—that's one of the most powerful times to use it. Opening the app when you feel the urge creates a pause between the emotion and the eating. Having a conversation about what you're feeling can help you process the emotion and make a conscious choice."
  },
  {
    question: "Is comfort eating the same as emotional eating?",
    answer: "Comfort eating is a type of emotional eating specifically focused on seeking comfort, relief, or soothing through food. Emotional eating is a broader term that includes eating in response to any emotion—stress, boredom, anxiety, celebration, etc. EmotionEat helps with all forms of emotional eating."

    <!-- Why Comfort Eating Happens -->
    <section class="py-20 bg-white">
      <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl">
        <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-8 text-center animate-on-scroll">
          Why Comfort Eating Happens
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-neutral-600 animate-on-scroll delay-100">
          <p class="mb-6">
            Comfort eating isn't a character flaw—it's a learned response. From childhood, many of us learned that food soothes difficult emotions. A cookie after a bad day at school, ice cream when we're sad, treats to celebrate good news. Our brains learned: food equals comfort.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            There's science behind it too. Comfort foods trigger dopamine release in the brain—the same reward chemical activated by other pleasurable experiences. When you're stressed, lonely, bored, or sad, your brain remembers that food provides quick relief. The craving isn't random; it's your brain seeking a solution it already knows works.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is that the relief is temporary. The emotion returns, often with guilt added on top. But understanding why comfort eating happens is the first step to changing it. When you recognize that you're seeking comfort—not food—you can start finding other ways to meet that need.

    <!-- Why Willpower Alone Doesn't Stop Comfort Eating -->
    <section class="py-20 bg-neutral-50">
      <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl">
        <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-8 text-center animate-on-scroll">
          Why Willpower Alone Doesn't Stop Comfort Eating
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-neutral-600 animate-on-scroll delay-100">
          <p class="mb-6">
            Comfort eating is emotional, not logical—so willpower targets the wrong problem. You can't "willpower" away an emotional need any more than you can willpower away loneliness or stress. The emotion is real, and it demands to be addressed.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Here's the cycle most people get stuck in: emotion arises, craving follows, eating happens, temporary relief comes, guilt sets in, the emotion returns (now with shame), and the cycle repeats. Trying harder with willpower often makes it worse because restriction increases the emotional intensity around food.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            What actually works is understanding the underlying emotion and finding different ways to meet that need. Instead of fighting the craving, you address what's causing it. Instead of self-criticism, you practice self-compassion—which, research shows, is far more effective at breaking cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal isn't to have more willpower. It's to build awareness so you can pause before the automatic response, recognize what you're really feeling, and choose how to respond.
