  {
    question: "What does \"overcoming\" emotional eating actually mean?",
    answer: "It doesn't mean you'll never eat emotionally again—it means you'll become aware of when it's happening and have the tools to choose differently. It's about building a healthier relationship with food and emotions, not achieving perfection."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from dieting?",
    answer: "Diets focus on what you eat and restrict foods. EmotionEat focuses on why you eat and builds awareness. We don't count calories or ban foods. We help you understand your emotional triggers so you can make conscious choices."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really overcome emotional eating without willpower?",
    answer: "Yes. Willpower fails because it fights against your emotional brain. Awareness works because it helps you understand what's really going on. When you recognize a trigger in the moment, you create space to choose a different response."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to overcome emotional eating?",
    answer: "Most users notice patterns within the first week. Meaningful change typically starts around 2-3 weeks of daily practice. Overcoming emotional eating is a journey, not a destination—but awareness builds faster than you might expect."
  },
  {
    question: "Is EmotionEat a replacement for therapy?",
    answer: "No. EmotionEat is a self-awareness tool that complements professional support. If you have an eating disorder or serious mental health concerns, please work with a healthcare provider. We're here to support your journey, not replace professional care."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I slip up and eat emotionally?",
    answer: "That's part of the process. EmotionEat isn't about perfection—it's about awareness. When you notice emotional eating, that's actually progress. You can use those moments to learn more about your triggers and build even greater awareness."

    <!-- Why Emotional Eating Happens -->
    <section class="py-20 bg-white">
      <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl">

          Why Emotional Eating Happens
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-neutral-600 animate-on-scroll delay-100">
          <p class="mb-6">
            Emotional eating is a learned response, not a character flaw. At some point, your brain discovered that food could provide quick relief from uncomfortable emotions. Stress, boredom, loneliness, anxiety—food offered a temporary escape, and your brain filed that away as a useful coping strategy.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            This happens because eating triggers the release of dopamine, the brain's reward chemical. That rush of pleasure creates a powerful association: feel bad → eat → feel better. Over time, this pattern becomes automatic. You might find yourself in the kitchen without even realizing how you got there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news? Because emotional eating is learned, it can be unlearned. Not through willpower or restriction, but through awareness. When you understand the triggers and patterns driving your eating, you gain the power to respond differently.

    <!-- What It Means to "Overcome" Emotional Eating -->
    <section class="py-20 bg-neutral-50">
      <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl">

          What It Means to "Overcome" Emotional Eating
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-neutral-600 animate-on-scroll delay-100">
          <p class="mb-6">
            Let's be clear: overcoming emotional eating doesn't mean you'll never eat for emotional reasons again. That's not realistic, and it's not the goal. Food is meant to be enjoyed, and sometimes eating is part of celebration, comfort, or connection.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Overcoming emotional eating means changing your relationship with food and emotions. It means becoming aware of when emotions are driving you to eat—and having the tools to pause and choose how you want to respond. Sometimes you'll still choose to eat. But it will be a conscious choice, not an automatic reaction.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            This journey is about progress, not perfection. It's about approaching yourself with compassion and curiosity rather than judgment. Every time you notice an emotional eating urge—whether you act on it or not—you're building awareness. That awareness is the foundation of lasting change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal isn't to become a person who never struggles. It's to become a person who understands their patterns, responds with intention, and treats themselves with kindness along the way.
