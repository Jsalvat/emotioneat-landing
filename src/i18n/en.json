      "q": "Is my data private and secure?",
      "a": "Absolutely. Everything you share is encrypted with the same security banks use. Your conversations are completely private—we'll never share or sell your data to anyone. What you tell the AI stays with the AI."
    },
    "question2": {
      "q": "How does this actually help me change?",
      "a": "Think of it as having a really insightful friend who notices patterns you don't. Our AI analyzes your daily conversations to spot what's really driving your eating habits. Then it gives you personalized challenges to help you build better patterns. It's like having a coach who knows your story."
    },
    "question3": {
      "q": "Can I cancel Premium anytime?",
      "a": "Yes! There's zero commitment. Cancel whenever you want and you'll keep Premium access until the end of your current billing period. The free plan is always available if you decide to downgrade."
    },
    "question4": {
      "q": "I'm terrible at journaling. Will this work for me?",
      "a": "Good news—this isn't journaling! It's more like texting a friend about your day. Just chat naturally about what happened, how you felt, and what you ate. The AI will ask helpful questions to keep the conversation going. No pressure, no blank pages."
    },
    "question5": {
      "q": "What's the real difference between Free and Premium?",
      "a": "Free is perfect for trying things out: 10 daily messages and weekly pattern analysis. Premium gives you 50 messages per day, daily analysis so you spot patterns faster, and explanations that show you exactly why each challenge is designed for you. Think of Premium as the fast track."
    },
    "question6": {
      "q": "Is this a replacement for therapy?",
      "a": "No, and we're upfront about that. EmotionEat helps you understand your patterns and build better habits, but it's a tool—not a therapist. If you're dealing with a serious eating disorder, please work with a qualified healthcare professional. We're here to support your journey, not replace professional care."
